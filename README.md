### Summary

In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

### Instructions

Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live. To do this, you’ll follow the steps below:

- Extract data from a database using a SQL query.
- Calculate a moving average in a spreadsheet.
- Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. Here are some questions to get you started.
Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
“How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
